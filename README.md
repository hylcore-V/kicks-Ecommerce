Introducing Kicks, an open-source e-commerce app built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It's fully customizable with product pages, shopping cart, and checkout functionality. The code I'll write in that project will follows best practices and will ensure it's bug-free and easy to maintain. Fork that and give this repo a star for a seamless shopping experience!
